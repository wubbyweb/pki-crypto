## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-15

### Added
- **Core PKI System**: Complete PKI token network with hierarchical verification
- **Multiple Verification Methods**: Chain, master-direct, issuer-direct, and hybrid verification
- **RSA Cryptographic Security**: 2048-bit RSA keys with PSS padding for signatures  
- **Interactive Token Manager**: User-friendly wizard interface for all PKI operations
- **Command Line Interface**: Full CLI with all PKI operations and verification modes
- **Secure Token Distribution**: Certificate packages without private key exposure
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 90+ tests covering unit, integration, and security testing
- **Documentation**: Complete tutorials, guides, and API documentation

### Features
- Master token creation with root certificate authority
- Hierarchical token issuance with automatic signature cascade
- Multi-level verification (chain traversal, direct master, issuer verification)
- Cryptographic hash chaining with SHA256
- RSA signature verification with master signature cascade
- Secure package creation for token distribution
- Input validation and security best practices
